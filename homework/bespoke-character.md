## Designing a Bespoke Character

For this assignment, I created a custom letterform inspired by a character from the modern English alphabet.

I selected the uppercase **“B”** and reinterpreted it in a bold **blackletter** style, defined by sharp angles, dramatic contrast, and flowing calligraphic curves. The form balances rigidity and ornament, combining precise geometric cuts with expressive strokes.

The result is a distinctive, handcrafted character that reflects my personal aesthetic and interest in expressive typography.
