# Business Card

This project is a redesign of my business card created as part of a class assignment. The goal was to translate a visual concept into a short written introduction that functions as a clear first impression — a visual and verbal handshake.

The task focused on communicating who I am, what I do, and my approach to design through minimal, concise text that remains readable and effective at a small scale.

I used my initials as the central visual element on the front of the card, treating them as a logo. The design emphasizes simplicity, materiality, and subtle typographic detail, allowing the form and texture to speak without unnecessary elements.
