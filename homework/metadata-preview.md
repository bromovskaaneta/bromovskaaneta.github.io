# Metadata and Preview Image Variations
## Goal of the Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to create and test multiple versions of metadata and preview images for a type specimen. The focus was on clarity, readability, and adaptability across different platforms and audiences.
The task also encouraged concise writing and the creation of preview images that remain legible and visually strong at various sizes and crops.

## Metadata Variations

As part of the assignment, three different metadata variations were created. Each variation includes a title, description, and alt text for my bespoke character.

### Title: 
The Weight of Form
Description: A reflection on expressive typography, exploring contrast, structure, and ornament within a single letterform.

### Alt Text: 
A stylized blackletter uppercase “B” in solid black with sharp angular forms and flowing curved strokes, embedded within a block of text.
Title: Structure Meets Expression

### Description: 
A visual exploration of how rigid geometry and fluid calligraphy can coexist in typographic design.
Alt Text: A bold blackletter “B” with high contrast and dramatic curves, set within a typographic layout.

### Title: 
One Letter, Many Voices
### Description: 
A study of how a single character can convey mood, rhythm, and identity through form and detail.
### Alt Text: 
An expressive Gothic-style “B” with sharp edges and elegant curves placed within a designed text composition.

## Preview Image Variations
The assignment also included creating three preview image variations, each using a different crop or visual adjustment to test legibility, impact, and balance across formats.
