# ABOUT ME

## Graphic designer & content creator

I’m mainly a graphic designer and content creator with a passion for creative work and visual communication. My experience includes graphic design, video editing, AI content creation, photography and post-production, as well as basic animation and motion graphics.

I focus on combining aesthetics with functionality across different projects — from logos and posters to full visual identities and social media videos for YouTube, Reels, TikTok, and more.

## Selected projects

Some of my key projects include:
- Winning design for **EuroTramvaj 2022**
- An infographic about the **Northern Lights**, created during my internship in Iceland
- **90th-anniversary logo** for ZŠ Zdenky Braunerové

## Current work & inspiration

I currently work at the agency **Media:list**, collaborating with brands such as **FUZE, BITmarkets, Biogaia, ZigZag House**, and others.

I’m inspired by art, nature, and new technologies, which helps me create original and thoughtful concepts.
